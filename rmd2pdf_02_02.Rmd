# Including Images and References

![Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 structure. This is an enveloped,
positive-sense RNA virus with four main structural proteins,
including spike (S) and membrane (M) glycoproteins, as well as envelope (E)
and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Figure and caption from
@Florindo2020.\label{f-intro_covid}](img/florindo2020_covid_drawing.jpg)

The figure \ref{f-intro_covid} cross-referencing is enabled by `\label{}` and
`\ref{}` commands. It refers to a bibtex reference `@Florindo2020` which is
rendered as "@Florindo2020", along with an entry added to the reference list at
the end of the document. The handling of reference is very convenient and
still readable in plain text. For instance if I want to refer
to reproducible science and Docker images [@Nuest2020] the bracketed reference
is added by `[@Nuest2020]`.
Several references can be used so I can refer to several items of my PhD
in a single reference [@Collin2018;@Collin2018b] with
`[@Collin2018;@Collin2018b]`.
This citation system is flexible enough to allow free text within the
citation call [@Kapica-Topczewska2019a, see the Kaplan-Meir step curves];
this last reference is as:
`[@Kapica-Topczewska2019a, see the Kaplan-Meir step curves]`.


# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
